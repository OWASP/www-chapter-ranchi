## Welcome
OWASP Ranchi is the Ranchi chapter of OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project—a global, open community devoted to making application software safer for everyone.

Our mission is to spark awareness and collaboration across all areas of cybersecurity—including application security, network security, cloud security, mobile security, endpoint protection, cryptography, incident response, security architecture, penetration testing, secure coding, security operations, and DevSecOps—among students, professionals, and organisations in Ranchi and neighbouring regions.

OWASP Ranchi chapter meetups are always free and open to anyone interested in learning, sharing, or contributing to cybersecurity. We encourage members to present on any topic related to OWASP or broader cybersecurity and believe in building a friendly, supportive community where everyone’s insights help us grow stronger together.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
