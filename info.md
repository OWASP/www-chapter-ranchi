### Ranchi Information
OWASP Ranchi is the Ranchi chapter of OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project—a global, open community devoted to making application software safer for everyone.

Our mission is to spark awareness and collaboration across all areas of cybersecurity—including application security, network security, cloud security, mobile security, endpoint protection, cryptography, incident response, security architecture, penetration testing, secure coding, security operations, and DevSecOps—among students, professionals, and organisations in Ranchi and neighbouring regions.

OWASP Ranchi chapter meetups are always free and open to anyone interested in learning, sharing, or contributing to cybersecurity. We encourage members to present on any topic related to OWASP or broader cybersecurity and believe in building a friendly, supportive community where everyone’s insights help us grow stronger together.
